# Applying-Supervised-Learning-To-Predict-Student-Dropout

In this project, we will examine student data and use supervised learning techniques to predict whether a student will drop out. In the education sector, retaining students is vital for the institution's financial stability and for students’ academic success and personal development. A high dropout rate can lead to significant revenue loss, diminished institutional reputation, and lower overall student satisfaction. 

While this project is focused on predicting student dropout in the education sector, the principles and methodologies applied are versatile and extend to various industries:

Healthcare: Predicting patient dropouts from treatment programmes based on demographics, treatment history, and health metrics to improve patient adherence and outcomes
Finance: Forecasting customer churn in banking and financial services by analysing transaction history, customer engagement, and financial behaviour to enhance customer retention strategies
Telecommunication: Identifying customers at risk of switching service providers by analysing usage patterns, customer service interactions, and billing information in order to tailor retention offers
Retail: Predicting customer attrition by examining purchase history, engagement with marketing campaigns, and customer satisfaction scores to design targeted loyalty programmes.
